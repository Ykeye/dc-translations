1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,711
И так, 10 часов, воскресенье.

2
00:00:01,743 --> 00:00:03,677
И у нас доклад " Заряженные питомцы....

3
00:00:03,688 --> 00:00:06,680
ВредоКот и Собака-Отказака"

4
00:00:06,864 --> 00:00:08,376
Автор- Gene Bransfield

5
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:15,570
Доброе утро Defcon

6
00:00:15,632 --> 00:00:17,552
Словами не выразить, как я рад тут стоять

7
00:00:16,668 --> 00:00:19,309
Давненько я хотел тут выступить

8
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:21,626
Внезапно, хотел бы начать с заявления...

9
00:00:21,726 --> 00:00:23,717
[неразборчиво]...не упомянать  "Big Data

10
00:00:23,718 --> 00:00:25,839
"APT", "Облако" или "кибер"....

11
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:27,871
Не упомянул...[cмеётся]

12
00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:31,957
[военные приступления!] (из аудитории)

13
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:37,339
Доброе утро. Будем заряжать ваших

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,750
питомцев. Поехали. Меня зовут Gene Bransfield,

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,360
Главный инженер-безопасник в "Tenacity Solutions".

16
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:45,248
И если вы достаточно хорошо меня узнаете,

17
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:47,542
вы поймете...я обожаю свою работу!

18
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:49,439
Круто вставать утром с мыслью:

19
00:00:49,546 --> 00:00:51,464
"Моя работа это прибыльно и классно"

20
00:00:51,528 --> 00:00:53,932
Знакомые мне говорят "А расскажи про свою работу, то-это...

21
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,880
Хотят мою должность...

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,759
Как бы не так. Не выйдет!

23
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,997
В моём стиле было бы умереть в пятницу

24
00:01:01,048 --> 00:01:02,575
в предпраздничную неделю.

25
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:04,285
Ну, а во вторник вечером все выйдут
А я там в углу валяюсь.

26
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:05,997
Приберут немного, и скажут: 
"На пятно не наступайте,

27
00:01:05,975 --> 00:01:10,579
Это памятное пятно на ковре имени Gene Bransfield'а"

28
00:01:10,532 --> 00:01:12,061
Так о чём речь?

29
00:01:12,106 --> 00:01:14,837
О угарнейшей идее!
Приведении её в исполнение.

30
00:01:14,898 --> 00:01:16,857
О взлётах и падениях.

31
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,850
О моих ошибках.

32
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,686
Слайдов куча,так что...

33
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,929
Заряжаем ваших питомцев?!?!?!
Ради всего святого...
Ну зачем?

34
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:29,403
Для справки: коты занимают 15% всего интернет траффика.

35
00:01:32,652 --> 00:01:35,357
Именно! Все знания человечества

36
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:37,316
Только руку протяни...

37
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,193
А мы котов смотрим и всю
эту дрянь в инете.

38
00:01:39,256 --> 00:01:41,241
Сам засыпаю на насыщенных докладах

39
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:42,814
А уж непосвещенным, так вообще тяжело.

40
00:01:42,787 --> 00:01:44,078
А донести надо!

41
00:01:44,086 --> 00:01:46,535
Но как только хоть
что-то научное всплывает

42
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,930
Сразу у всех глаза закатились
и всё! Полетели в свои облака

43
00:01:48,877 --> 00:01:53,362
Потому я стал добавлять котов и шутки
про котов

44
00:01:53,462 --> 00:01:56,392
Вообще всё с этой картинки началось.


45
00:01:57,045 --> 00:01:59,532
Ооо.Да хватит вам!

46
00:02:00,169 --> 00:02:03,518
Ясно, как день,
что картинка крутая!

47
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,726
Как-то после одной такой презентации
ко мне подходит чел

48
00:02:05,773 --> 00:02:09,344
и даёт мне кошачий ошейник!
С GPS чипом,

49
00:02:09,444 --> 00:02:13,400
сотовой связью! С функцией трекинга кошки!

50
00:02:13,443 --> 00:02:17,819
Отсылаешь туда СМС, в ответ приходят координаты
кошки

51
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:23,103
Ну и я такой человек, что сразу подумал:
 "Прикрутим Wi-Fi сниффер и ВредоКот готов"

52
00:02:23,326 --> 00:02:26,115
Ну а Собака-Отказака....
Как-то я посещал Outerz0ne

53
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:27,002
Это другая хакерская конференция

54
00:02:26,984 --> 00:02:29,220
Lady Merlin туда пришла с псом,
у которого на шлейке

55
00:02:29,302 --> 00:02:30,974
Написано было:
"Собака-отказака"

56
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:33,284
И я такой: "О!Крутота, а что, там Pineaple чтоль? 
или вроде того?"

57
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:36,039
А она мне : "Да нет, просто если садишься работать,
 то пёс прыгает тебе на колени...


58
00:02:36,062 --> 00:02:37,835
И работать ты больше не можешь.

59
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,932
Однако, Pineapple- отличная идея!"

60
00:02:41,263 --> 00:02:43,014
Служебные животные это конечно не новость.

61
00:02:43,048 --> 00:02:50,654
Военные собаки, полицейские собаки, крутейшие псы,
десантирующиеся из самолёта в воду

62
00:02:48,107 --> 00:02:52,742
А есть псы еще круче!

63
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,393
Человек в дыхательной маске. Видите?

64
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:57,289
А у пса не видите. А она есть!

65
00:02:57,337 --> 00:02:59,336
Сошёл с самолёта вместе с хозяином на высоте в  9 км!

66
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,437
Вот это КРУТЕЙШИЙ пёс!

67
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:07,950
А тут у нас настоящий морской котик.

68
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,490
Истинная правда, морфлот применяет водоплавующих

69
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,896
Для защиты морских портов, поиска мин
и всякого такого.

70
00:03:13,955 --> 00:03:17,162
Враг думает незаметно пробраться в порт
и взорвать всё к чертям

71
00:03:17,178 --> 00:03:18,561
А тут..."хлоп" и

72
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:20,570
Флиппер с гопрохой!

73
00:03:21,252 --> 00:03:22,909
Вот чёрт!

74
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:25,487
Ну или вот, например.

75
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:27,460
Проект, вроде, 60ых годов.
"Акустокошечка".

76
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,570
Похоже в то время
ЦРУшники дымили по-чёрному.

77
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,988
За столом сидят такие:

78
00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:35,629
"Берём, значит, кошку,

79
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,492
Передатчик вживим в крудную клетку
Микрофон в ухо
По спине пустим антенну из провода

80
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:41,884
Назовём "Акустокошечка"

81
00:03:44,032 --> 00:03:46,338
Так на это еще и денег выбили!
Не шучу!

82
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,484
Провели множество опытов,
понаучили свою науку.

83
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,683
Настало время опробовать
в поле.

84
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,200
Взяли кошку.

85
00:03:54,242 --> 00:03:55,796
Говорят ей- "Следи вон за теми товарищами"

86
00:03:55,827 --> 00:03:57,310
Кошка выходит на дорогу.
[шмяк]

87
00:03:57,327 --> 00:03:59,629
Вот и нет акустокошечки!

88
00:04:01,072 --> 00:04:04,826
Финансирование в итоге сняли,
но не потому что идея плохая

89
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:09,240
А т.к. учёные задолбались с кошками возиться

90
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:11,548
И это очень важное открытие!
Вернёмся к этому позже

91
00:04:11,662 --> 00:04:13,070
И так.
Что нам понадобится

92
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,690
Концепция операции:
Надеваем на кошку ошейник/шлейку

93
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:18,292
Прикручиваем приборы для сбора данных

94
00:04:18,414 --> 00:04:21,294
Нулевое правило:
"Не навреди коту"

95
00:04:21,307 --> 00:04:23,780
Я не люблю кошек
Но я не хочу случайно нанести вред
животному.

96
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:25,214
Это точно не в моём стиле.

97
00:04:25,246 --> 00:04:26,250
Первое правило:

98
00:04:26,383 --> 00:04:29,682
Наша нагрузка должна быть удобна и безопасна
для животного

99
00:04:29,718 --> 00:04:31,121
Гармония формы и функциональности

100
00:04:31,141 --> 00:04:33,331
Также, никаких мигающих огоньков,
которые могут привлечь птицу какую-нибудь, 

101
00:04:33,362 --> 00:04:35,020
"О! Что это там за синий огонёк..

102
00:04:35,106 --> 00:04:37,014
О! КОШКА![шмяк]

103
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:42,229
GPS для записи маршрута, 
Wi-Fi сниффер чтоб получить нужные данные

104
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:45,620
А вообще есть уже готовые кошачьи продукты:

105
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:50,223
Mr Lee Cat Cam
Небольшая камера, подвешенная за ошейник,
Pet Tracker

106
00:04:50,385 --> 00:04:54,027
Но со сниффером ничего нет.
Так что можно продолжать.

107
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:59,156
Много вариантов перебрал.
Вот решение с помощью gumstick.
Прикольный одноплатный компьютер.

108
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:01,748
Маленький, но довольно дорогой.

109
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,416
Cotton Candy. Еще один одноплатник.
Неплохое решение

110
00:05:04,536 --> 00:05:11,605
Rockchip 3066
Опенсорсная штуковина, которая подключается к телевизору 
для HD стриминга видео.

111
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:13,764
Но под него есть образ Kali Linux

112
00:05:13,742 --> 00:05:15,952
У меня никак не выходило его туда накатить

113
00:05:16,068 --> 00:05:24,135
и я присел, пивка взял. Задумался.
Что-то небольшое, с GPS, WIFI 
и сотовой связью.

114
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:27,662
Есть идеи что это это за штуковина?

115
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,397
Может телефон?

116
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:32,209
Всё это время в кармане лежал.

117
00:05:32,255 --> 00:05:35,629
Ок, круто!
Покодим под андроид, сделаем APK...
Да?

118
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,369
Не! Уже есть такое.

119
00:05:37,448 --> 00:05:43,243
Называется WiGLE
Карманный вардрайвер прямо из Android Store
В любое время, в любом месте.

120
00:05:43,393 --> 00:05:44,382
Прикольно

121
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,366
Теперь нам нужен доброволец.

122
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:52,656
Это Скитзи.
Кот моего друга Ривса.


123
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,558
56 см от основания шеи до основания хвоста
50см обхват груди
30 - обхват шеи

124
00:05:56,828 --> 00:05:59,150
Чертовски здоровенный котяра.

125
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:03,088
Потому, я не сильно переживал,
 что его друзья засмеют за мои шмотки

126
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:04,819
Отобъется.

127
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:08,004
Короче, нужна попона или сбруя для кота

128
00:06:08,098 --> 00:06:09,797
И

129
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:15,125
Если вы загуглите "Сбруя для кошки"
то найдёте разные наименования

130
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,342
Но если загуглить "Сбруя для киски"
То можно и другие результаты получить.

131
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:20,605
С работы точно пробовать не стоит.

132
00:06:20,626 --> 00:06:26,203
В итоге смекнул, что если взять попону
 для достаточно маленькой собаки,
то она и на кошку пойдёт.

133
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,762
Так и сделал. 

134
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,955
План такой:
Технику на попону
Попону на кошку

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,165
Кошку на прогулку!
По возвращении снять данные
Профит?

136
00:06:33,152 --> 00:06:34,626
Так?

137
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:36,657
1- технику на попону

138
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:39,069
2- попону на кошку

139
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:42,669
Как видите он в восторге.

140
00:06:43,642 --> 00:06:46,150
Оправляем кошку на прогулку
и профит?
Да?

141
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:48,372
Нет!

142
00:06:50,028 --> 00:06:52,539
Это на заднем дворе!! [смеётся]

143
00:06:55,428 --> 00:06:58,862
Какие ошибки мы тут видим?  

144
00:06:58,891 --> 00:06:59,591
Очевидно, что сбрую 

145
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:08,792
coat, and the coat on the cat,
and send him on a walk about and
we wait. It is 18 hours later

146
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:16,458
people are freaking out. We are
at the backdoor and hear a meow,
this is the cat. And the form

147
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:22,458
factor of the cat going out the
door and coming back in. So we
failed on that, the last known

148
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:30,458
GPS location of it is right
here. We went there and it is
not there. So, so far we learned

149
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:38,208
that cats are really hard to
work with. You should always
test your expensive stuff out

150
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:42,708
before sending it out on a cat
someplace. I'm again to need an
Amazon prime account. They were

151
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:48,458
worried about the cat, no more
coat. I was talking to my
friend, Bill, about this, he

152
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:55,292
laughed and said why don't you
try a  small power and
consumption, and there are chips

153
00:07:55,292 --> 00:08:02,375
and solutions out there. My
first question is what is
Arduino? A  project with a

154
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:09,458
researcher in Italy, like his
master's thesis. There is open
source software out there, and

155
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:15,292
why not open source hardware. It
is cool. Comes in a  chip set,
you can stack them on it, and

156
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:22,500
make robot, and remote control
car. This guy used it to check
the food in his freezer. This

157
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:28,292
guy used it to make the robot's
hand move, and this guy used to
cheat on his video games.

158
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:34,958
Relatively small form factor.
The good news with Arduino is
Open Source and inexpensive,

159
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,583
until the cat starts loosing
them and you have to buy nine of
them. Bad news, poorly

160
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:43,792
documented it can take forever
to get to you, an expansion
shield, sometimes okay. Cool,

161
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:49,792
that's great. But I have never
done doing, and worked with
small chips. I'm not a

162
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:57,958
professional coder and I have
never  soldered before. It is
solder. Like what. He said,

163
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:06,958
don't worry, it's easy. The plan
is to get some Arduino the
stuff, sign on the form factor,

164
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,875
put it together on a  collar and
figure out something for the
denial service dog. So I went

165
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:17,542
out and bought the how to book.
There was guides and learning
and reading up on it with

166
00:09:17,542 --> 00:09:23,708
electronics stuff. So I get the
flashy stuff flashing and the
non flashy things flashing when

167
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:28,625
they're not suppose to flash. So
I said I'm ready to go, need the
more advance stuff. Libraries

168
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:34,625
for Wi‑ Fi, they got it, GPS,
they got it. SD card stuff, they
got it. So, Jeremyblum.com, this

169
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:40,625
has a lot of videos on making
these things work. I used him
religiously. Thank God. I did

170
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:48,042
all of my research and
background investigation, I'm
now an expert. I went out and

171
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:54,042
got a  Wi‑ Fi and a GPS child.
So my plan is to get the Wi‑ Fi
stuff and writing to an SD card

172
00:09:56,333 --> 00:10:02,875
and GPS writing to an SD card,
combine the two and then profit.
The Wi‑ Fi shield was cool.

173
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:08,417
Setup, the drivers worked away.
And hooked it up and was even
mentioned on the Arduino

174
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:13,958
website, the parameters and
variables. Got my solution. That
was easy. GPS not so much easy.

175
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:19,375
A little bit about GPS, the NMEA
string is what the satellites
are broadcasting up there,

176
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:25,042
national maritime electronic
association. This comma
separated value there is what

177
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:32,042
the satellite is actually
sending out and the job of the
receive take it in and transmit

178
00:10:32,042 --> 00:10:37,708
to (?) So  the GPS boot process
is starts up and it doesn't know
where it is on the planet. Could

179
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:43,208
be in your back pocket on
Timbuktu. It has to listen to
space. So the GPS process was

180
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:48,417
fairly poorly documented. Get at
least satellites to listen to
and figure out where it is, this

181
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:53,625
process can take two to 15
minutes. And if someone is
looking over your shoulder it is

182
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:58,833
going to take 15 minutes. The
GPS shield was rather poorly
documented. There was no docs in

183
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:04,542
the kit. It took my several
weeks of what is wrong with
this, why is it not working.

184
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:11,000
Finally at the long end of the
research effort the baud rate is
supposed to be 34,800. I wanted

185
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,250
to give demonstration is how it
is poorly documented. Now I go
on line and cannot find the it

186
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,667
is 34800. The GPS shield is off
to the side. Because I was going
to use the pins. I put this

187
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:26,667
together and combined the code
and got this weird error about
80% memory utilization. I see

188
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:43,875
that on windows blow it off and
go for it. They were telling me
the truth. 80%, the chip cannot

189
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:50,708
work. 32K on the memory. The
Arduino mega, however, has 256K.
And I purchased the mega. Put

190
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:56,917
that together, messed around
with variables, messed around
with some stuff and Woo Hoo it

191
00:11:56,917 --> 00:12:02,917
works. A  working prototype. So
the Arduino 2550, more better mo
betta, mo ports. But the size is

192
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:11,875
not mo better. So I searched all
over the internet tried to find
something that is ting 2560 from

193
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:24,792
JK Devices.com. It is a  ripoff,
I was going to mention it during
my talk. Defcon knows about

194
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:30,792
that. I didn't know about that
at a time, I need a  Wi‑ Fi
chip, you can see the breakout

195
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:40,375
board chip there, this is the
spark cord, I call it the
mullet, because Wi‑ Fi in the

196
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:47,917
front and, Arduino in the back.
And of course a  GPS chip, and
a  SD card breakout board. So

197
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:53,917
the mega worked but the mega
mini was four weeks to ship and
another solutions are too big in

198
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:05,792
size and too small in memory. So
I went with the spark core that
had troubled shipping. So I

199
00:13:05,792 --> 00:13:12,208
borrowed one from Bill, who got
me started on this. It is a  32
bit, 128K of memory, SPI, and

200
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:18,208
12D those are like the protocol
chips kind of like the Internet
and had that, a TICC3 Wi‑ Fi

201
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
chip. It is it compatible? No.
People that are a  chip head
will say yes. If you say it is

202
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,458
Ardiomo compatible , it mean it
will work with my external
component an I can just cut and

203
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:43,333
past the code, from one to
another and and that's how it
works. So this is one thing, the

204
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:47,375
spark cord is another. I will
have to start over again from
scratch. That made me not happy.

205
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:56,000
Despite this problem, the spark
was very, very cool. A 
dedicated core group of

206
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,917
developers I would looking at
the code, and one developer
would say I would like to do

207
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:05,458
blah, and then they would stay
up all night and blah, I figured
this stuff is getting updated. A

208
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:10,167
shout out to peekay123 who
helped me a lot on my project! I
figured all this stuff is

209
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:15,000
getting updated so let's see
what happens. Libraries, someone
posted SD libraries at the

210
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,292
forums they compiled. Good
morning, libraries, they
combined and worked with my GPS

211
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:27,875
shield. Wi‑ Fi libraries not so
much. The spark cord bills
itself as an Internet of things

212
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:31,667
device. I'm going to say that a
couple of times because it
screwed me a  couple of times.

213
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:36,708
So the Wi‑ Fi is in the
background as a service, you are
coding up front and just connect

214
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:42,792
you to the Internet. Not there
to mess with, but I want to mess
with it. The Adafruit board that

215
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:49,417
I bought the exact same chip. It
and it is available library for
download. And I messed with it

216
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:56,250
before. Thomas Edison said I
found 100 ways not to make the
lightbulb, before making the

217
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:02,250
lightbulb. I found a lot of ways
to make a  kitty collar. I
messed with these things and had

218
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:12,042
some SSID scanning stuff and
copied and pasted it and put it
in there, bam, it worked. Yes.

219
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:19,708
Now, I have the good morning,
working on the spark. The SD
compiled on the spark. SSID is

220
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:26,542
working. Now working with the
tiny components that I bout and
that means soldering. Who looks

221
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:31,500
to solder and likes it?
Soldering is my new least
favorite activity. So for those

222
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:37,500
getting ready to learn how to
solder have rules. Rule number
one, don't touch the pointy end.

223
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:47,625
That's where the hotness is.
Rule number two is remembering
where you put the soldering iron

224
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:53,625
down. If you violate rule number
two, you're going to violate
rule number one. Rule number

225
00:15:56,667 --> 00:16:03,083
three is everything looks so
easy on the Internet and it's
not. So that not withstanding my

226
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:09,750
first attempt went well. I put
the SD breakout board here, this
is my breadboard stuff, the chip

227
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:15,042
on the left side. There's a
core, breakout board, had to
solder ends onto the end for and

228
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:22,750
the GPS antenna. That went
pretty good. I'm home testing
everything went great. And

229
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:27,250
getting sniffing, doing stuff, I
put it in my yard, the
neighbor's Wi‑ Fi, and I took it

230
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:33,250
on a  car ride, and there was
massive failure, nothing. Why
not? Well, again, the spark is

231
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,792
an Internet of things device, it
is never meant not to be
connected the Internet. So I was

232
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:41,750
talking to the guys on the
forums and they said turn the
chip on and off because it will

233
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:48,458
suck power. But when you turn it
on put the code put it in the
status equals Wi‑ Fi on. It is

234
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:54,458
true if there is a known access
point. If I'm a  half mile down
the road that will not happen. I

235
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:06,667
could turn on the chip and do my
scan before it made a 
connection. That worked

236
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:12,375
perfectly. I removed the code
from the stuff. That is all that
I needed. I'm back on track. So

237
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:19,000
I took it for a  drive and got
data back. And so I was popping
the into Google Earth. I was

238
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,417
driving on the highway, they had
me off in a lake and I was
sitting in my house was I

239
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:28,750
halfway down the block. So I was
wondering what was going on. So
who posted the GPS library, they

240
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:36,583
did the NMEA conversion
incorrectly. So now I have no
GPS libraries. So when I was

241
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:41,333
working on the Aduino stuff, I
had the GPS plus‑ plus  ‑ ‑
stuff that I loved to use, so

242
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:47,292
easy to interact with. And it
had everything that I needed. So
I needed to find someone to put

243
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:54,292
the GPS plus plus into the spark
and I talked to Bill and said he
port libraries. I said how do

244
00:17:54,292 --> 00:18:00,875
you port libraries. He explained
it to me like my rocket science
story, having drinks in a  bar

245
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,833
and somebody and he is a cool
guy. What do you do for a 
living? I'm a  rocket scientist.

246
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,083
Seriously. No, seriously, I'm a 
rocket scientist. That is cool,
what do you think about the

247
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:11,750
phrase, it's not rocket science.
I laugh at that, there are
science and engineering to

248
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:17,750
building the rocket and fuel in
them, but you put the rocket on
the launch pad and hit the red

249
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:29,333
button and hope for the best.
Sometimes it blows up. Sometimes
it tips over and blows up.

250
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:39,833
Sometimes it gets to space and
blows up. The hard part is not
getting new rockets, the hard

251
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:45,833
part is getting more monkeys to
put in the rocket. That is a 
rocket science joke. That's how

252
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:55,292
you port libraries. We changed
our Arduino stuff out with the
spark stuff, hit compile, listen

253
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:59,000
to it scream at you and fix what
it is screaming about. You keep
doing that until it doesn't

254
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,500
scream anymore. If you compiling
is screening at you, and you
scream back, you succeed at

255
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:09,500
scaring your wife. I did that
for a  couple of hours and BAM,
it works. I ported libraries. I

256
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:17,708
was so proud of myself I posted
them to github. The next problem
is then power consumption, my

257
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:26,333
buddy Ricky Hill hooked me up
with the batteries for model
airline stuff. 3.7‑ volts,

258
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:31,542
500mAh batteries - enough to get
a kiddy thing going. So now I'm
testing for the optimal power

259
00:19:31,542 --> 00:19:37,000
consumption. The first thing you
think of is I will turn
everything on, get the stuff,

260
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,917
and turn everything off.
Remember, before I told you it
can take 2 to 15 minutes to get

261
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:46,875
the GPS lock. If you turn it off
the GPS, you lose the satellite,
and you the cat runs into bush

262
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:53,292
you burn through without getting
any data. So the best thing for
me, you turn the main micro

263
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:58,625
controller on and keep the GPS
powered and that worked much,
much better. Much better,

264
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:03,583
collections every 30 seconds
lasted 4 hours, collections
every 10 minutes lasted 8 hours.

265
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:10,750
So now I have to make a  collar.
If you thought soldering is fun.
Desoldering is twice as much fun

266
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:16,292
as soldering. Oh, may God, I
destroyed so much crap trying to
desolder things. The Internet

267
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:22,125
was not helpful. YouTube looked
to easy. I talked to my friend,
Joey. Head to your lab and they

268
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:27,833
will help out. Shout out to the
labs in Virginia. Ted, mad
scientist, and evil genius

269
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:34,958
helped me to do this. Did not
end up in the final one. And
Brian my solder tutor. Taught me

270
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:42,417
the right iron and the right
solder make life a whole hell of
a lot easier. So now I can to

271
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:48,458
make the collar itself. And hard
stuff. Man, I don't know how to
make a  collar. The code thing,

272
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:53,167
I just learned to solder, but
this is like ribbons. So talking
to my friend Joe, he said get a

273
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:59,167
couple of ribbons and sew it
together and put your stuff
inside of it. So I went down to

274
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:05,167
Michaels and got myself a 
ribbon, leopard print is just so
in this year for the cats. Now,

275
00:21:07,417 --> 00:21:14,333
I need to sew it together. Who
knows to sew, it is 2014. We
don't sew, we buy new stuff. It

276
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:20,333
is a grandmother skill, right?
So what do you do? You get a 
grandmother. So my wife's

277
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:28,750
grandmother, her name is Nancy.
She is very nice to meet you.
She was very happy to help me

278
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:34,625
and there is a dollar bill
followed by the battery, the
actual collar and the components

279
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:41,708
all wrapped up to protect
things. The spark had flashy
bits. Now, back to our volunteer

280
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:47,708
cat. This bastard still owes me
a  cell phone. So we're going to
send him out with some practice

281
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:54,917
stuff first and see if he comes
back with it. Then I might let
him play with the tech. So we

282
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:59,292
put the collar on him to see if
he tolerated it, he tolerate it,
and he tolerated marvelously.

283
00:21:59,292 --> 00:22:05,292
This is what it looked like
before and what it looks like
now. It is all cool, put you can

284
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:15,458
see the bit behind his head.
That is the name collar it is to
go on the bottom because the GPS

285
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:21,292
chip is directly opposite. We
have to put a  weight on it.
Went down to ranger supply. It

286
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:27,042
is war kit. A  bullet. So the
cat goes on the collar, and the
collar goes on the cat. And the

287
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:34,250
cat goes for a  walk and profit.
And the deployments were,
nothing. No, no. No. I knew it

288
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:38,792
works. I grabbed my stuff and
went to my buddy's Reeve's
house. All of the diagnostics

289
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:46,292
work working fine. We put the
collar on the cat, and the cat,
we had a couple beers, the cat

290
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:52,292
went under a  bush and hung out
there and licked himself for 20
minutes. He is licking himself.

291
00:22:54,375 --> 00:23:01,167
I said, Reeves is that the cat
under the bush. No, walked up.
Yes and he grabs the bush and

292
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:07,167
shakes it. The cat was running.
A  better deployment process was
let the collar set outside 5 to

293
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:15,208
10 minutes. Bring the cat to the
collar, put on the cat and let
the cat go for a  walk about. So

294
00:23:19,042 --> 00:23:24,833
does this work? Success,
bitches. Here is the initial
results for obvious reasons.

295
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:30,542
Somebody contacted me off of the
Internet and said I can help you
out with visualizing this. Check

296
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:38,125
this out. Somebody did this for
me. It is awesome. I would like
to point out I have been working

297
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:43,833
on this for a  good number of
months and the damn cat never
left the front yard. Yeah.

298
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:49,833
Furthest he went was the car. My
grandmother was saying I would
love to know I Coco goes, so we

299
00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:02,792
strapped it up to Coco and got
results. I'd like to printout,
But we still have WEP and open

300
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:08,792
Wi‑ Fi hotspots in 2014. Oh, my
God. So but cocoa went a lot
further as you will see. He

301
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:22,208
wondered all over the
neighborhood. He's going to take
a  while. He actually caught a

302
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:36,500
mouse during this deployment
that was very, very cool. Really
cool results. The cats tolerated

303
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,500
it brilliantly, and it was the
fruition of a  long bunch of
work. I cannot tell you how

304
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:47,500
happy I was. So that is the war
kitty, ladies and gentlemen. [
Applause ] So now we move onto

305
00:24:57,083 --> 00:25:03,083
the Denial of Service Dog
admittedly is just trolling.
Nothing socially redeeming about

306
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:16,958
it at all. I have a  pineapple I
bought at Shmoo, a  TV B Gone at
Radio Shack, doggie backpack

307
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:21,667
with the service dog patches on
it. There is the pineapple, you
know what it is. I had Karma

308
00:25:21,667 --> 00:25:26,167
answering probes and DNS spoof
to redirect to the pineapple.
And there is a  package you can

309
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:32,167
download that has five or six
things that it cycles through as
people connect to it. It is

310
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:40,542
awesome. So he's the TV B Gone.,
as it comes with my new found
soldering skills I turned it,

311
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:47,750
what was supposed to be this,
into this. And the idea being I
was going puts saddlebags and

312
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:51,833
the T.V. in the saddlebag and
connect the wires to the outside
so the LEDs were on the outside

313
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:57,917
of the saddlebag. Now I need
patches. Holy crap, how hard is
it to get somebody to make your

314
00:25:57,917 --> 00:26:04,375
patches. Except on the Internet,
500 of them, $5  a  piece. So I
beat the streets for quite a

315
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:10,375
while, and I found a  JoAnnes in
Sterling,Virginia and they made
me a  denial of service dog

316
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:20,250
patch. The Wi‑ Fi thing right
there. I have a video
demonstration to proof it works

317
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:25,458
there. There is the denial of
service dog stuff. And the LED
sticking outside of the

318
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:32,208
saddlebag. I ran a  wire up the
leash and have a  button in my
hand right there. Taped the wire

319
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:37,708
to the leash. You hit the button
right there, you see the little
green light, and then they start

320
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:45,625
flashing on the fruit and then
the T.V. will then just turn on.
And here's the demonstration

321
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:51,625
video of it working. You've got,
I'm outside somewhere. You will
see that the denial of service

322
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:59,125
dog has this ssid is up. Another
thing I did. I'm going to add a 
Wi‑ Fi hotspot, it is going to

323
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:05,125
be called Defcon. And I'm
filming with one hand and doing
the other, forgive me, it took

324
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:15,583
me a long time. I'm trying to
connect. That is me over here,
pop up and connect. And go out

325
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:21,583
to the Internet, excuse us. >> I
said welcome to Def Con earlier.
We have a tradition here  ‑ ‑

326
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,500
and if you've never seen this
tradition, it is a wonderful
tradition where new speakers get

327
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,292
welcomed to Def Con with an
appropriate beverage of choice.
[ Applause ] So  ‑ ‑ since Gene

328
00:27:35,292 --> 00:27:41,292
has never spoken at Def Con
before, we decided to welcome
him, even to the extent of

329
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,792
interrupting his presentation.
We would like to welcome him to
Def Con for the first time

330
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:57,792
speaker. [ Applause ] >> Good
morning. >> Thank you. >> Wow.
>> Here is the denial of service

331
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:11,750
dog. Awesome. So the long story 
‑ ‑ let's see, where I was? Yes.
I'm playing with this, I wish

332
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:25,500
there was a  way to speed it up.
Are we going to go through it
all again? That is good stuff.

333
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:32,167
So I added Def Con to the whole
thing. And camera is going to
see the probe go out, it is me,

334
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:38,125
and pull it back into the Wi‑ Fi
pineapple. That's how it all
works and it works brilliantly.

335
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:44,125
So it will pop up, bam, I'm Def
Con. The funny part I tried to
do this later and there is the

336
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:52,375
Def Con AP. See, I go up, it is
like. ¶ [ Music ] ¶ Circus  ‑ ‑
dot dot Afro. So I'm going to go

337
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:58,375
to CNN and it is come to come
up, polk‑ a‑ dot polk‑ a‑ dot
Afro. That's how that things

338
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:14,333
works. Now, we need a volunteer
dog, to be our denial of service
dog. If you ever seen a

339
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:23,667
Doberman pinscher service dog.
Well you have. The denial of
service dog. He was so happy, he

340
00:29:23,667 --> 00:29:29,667
ran the yard. I'm so happy, new
people, new people. So we dug
him inside of the house and put

341
00:29:35,792 --> 00:29:41,792
the backpack on him, he stood
like this for 10 minutes. And
that's good. Because it allowed

342
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:50,208
me to take pictures. There is
the service dogs in there. And
that is going on there. The

343
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:59,167
first thing the V dog did when
he stopped being comatose. What
we discovered two things. One

344
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:06,792
there is now two ways to deploy
the TVB Gone, one is the button
and the other is the dog shakes.

345
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:13,000
The other things I discovered
and failed to properly secure it
into the pouch. Every time he

346
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,375
did that, it well flying all
over the place. In the process
of doing so completely destroyed

347
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:24,667
my TVB Gone to the point even
with my new soldering abilities
I was not able to bring it back.

348
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:30,667
So next. So the funny thing is 
‑ ‑ if it says service dog on
your dog's backpack, they will

349
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:40,917
let you in. [ Laughter ] Mine
very clearly said denial of
service. But service dog. Yeah.

350
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:49,042
Sure. Here is the part I tell
you one man's video proof to
Defcon, is another man's

351
00:30:49,042 --> 00:30:55,792
evidence to court. The truth of
the matter is I, was so focused
on denial of service dog. I hit

352
00:30:55,792 --> 00:31:01,000
the wrong button on go pro. It
has 2 buttons, I hit the wrong
one, so I need to go ex KC on

353
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
you here. I love to play. Do you
mind if we come in. Sure. Do you
want something to drink. And

354
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:18,083
then off here. Peanut jelly
time. Peanut butter jelly time.
[ Laughter ] I'm taking artistic

355
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:26,792
license here. Still. So the
third our four  ‑ ‑ or fourth
time the guy came to our table

356
00:31:26,792 --> 00:31:32,792
and said why does it say denial
of service dog. Props to this
guy, because he was the only one

357
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:41,833
all day long that asked. We
didn't answer him, and he went
away. So you go to the sports

358
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:49,125
bar and hit the bottom. Ball
play, and it was the world cup
game, just happens to be the

359
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:55,125
Argentina and you hit the button
and it goes away. Never going to
give you up. [ Laughter ] So if

360
00:32:04,833 --> 00:32:10,833
you go into a  restaurant that
has 15 TVs on wall, they are
controlled by the back. But one

361
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:22,083
or two TVs on the wall. They are
not. Just saying. So then  ‑ ‑
yeah. He is happy. Then we go

362
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:31,333
into a  J random box store
someone. And the V dog is like I
love you. We're walking around

363
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:38,583
the owner has his leash in one
hand and his hand on the
backpack. This is not a service

364
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:44,917
dog. But nobody  ‑ ‑ and the guy
is like do you mind if we come
in. Sure. Make sure that he

365
00:32:44,917 --> 00:32:52,125
doesn't poop on anything. This
actually happened. And then we
go back to the TV section, and,

366
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:57,667
of course, the V dog was like
squirrel, we hit the button and
the thing goes up and the

367
00:32:57,667 --> 00:33:05,125
television goes away, yeah! We
did wonderful things. Circus,
afro circus, Afro. So according

368
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:11,125
to the results several victims
connected the denial of service
dog. I cannot definitively proof

369
00:33:13,917 --> 00:33:19,292
anyone connected why we are out
I took artistic license, however
when giving this presentation to

370
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:25,292
my company, people were hacked
right and left. It's Gene. Only
one person asked about the

371
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:38,875
denial of service dog. Most
people just said nice doggie.
What have we learned? A  tech

372
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:46,000
hobbyist with no experience can
create a  war collar in
relatively short time. You can

373
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,833
do this, too. I didn't go a 
damn thing about this stuff when
I was started. But I kept at it

374
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:56,833
and in 2014 there are unsecured
hotspots. And lot of devices
still probed for stuff. There is

375
00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:07,042
no patch for human stupidity and
cats and dogs really hard to
work with. I have to give a

376
00:34:16,917 --> 00:34:22,917
shout out to all of these
devices. JK devices they are
terrible. Don't go there.

377
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:43,042
Reeves, still, Joe, Joey, Nancy,
Bill, the spark.io guys, the app
guys, V-dog, Skitzy CoCo,

378
00:34:57,667 --> 00:35:03,667
Tenacity, and, of course,
Defcon, I'm so proud to be here.
[ Applause ]
